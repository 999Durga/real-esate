1 Glad to share my work on a Deta Set "Real-Estate".

2 As the Data Set containing demographic information such as "Transaction Date","House Age","Distance To The Nearest MRT Station","Number of Convenience Stores","Latitude ","Longitude " and "House Price of Unit Area"

3 This project aims to is  real estate price analysis and prediction. The goal could be to study how different factors (e.g., house age, proximity to MRT stations, number of convenience stores) impact the house price per unit area.

4 This type of data is commonly used in machine learning models for predictive analytics in real estate, helping buyers, sellers, or investors make informed decisions.

5 Using POWER BI as Data Visualization tool for creating a Dash Board and performed DAX to showcase report findings.

6 I had  completed my Power Bi Data Visualization project in Teks Academy ,as a part of #DataScience Course,#DataVisualization  under Ameerpet branch under Amena Zoha.
